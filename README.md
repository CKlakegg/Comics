# Comics
Code Challenge

The project architecture is MVVM. 


If I had had more time I would have prorated to finish:


-Add comics to the favorites list and make this available offline too with the use of UserDefaults 
-Make a web view in the app for the searching of comics, I choose to make a link that opens a URL and navigates to the browser because the search functionality doesn't work in API
